## Contributing

Because this is starting as school project (see the following section), we will not be accepting pull requests until September 2020, after the end of the course.
In September, the repository will be updated with information about contributing code.
Right now, the best way to contribute is to use the extension, and open issues with problems you encounter or features you want to see.
